# blog-tools

A simple blog tooling package that will automatically look for markdown files 
and convert them into HTML blog posts. Intended for use with Rocket and Tera 
templates, but could be used elsewhere.

## Example 

You can run the example blog with

```
cargo +nightly run --example blog  
```

For now Rocket requires the use of nightly toolchains. You can then view the 
blog at localhost:8080.
